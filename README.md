# Amazon Recommender System | NYU MSBAi Final Project

## Project Objective
This project was developed as part of the final assignment for the **"AI & Recommender Systems"** module in the NYU MSBAi program.  
The task was to build a predictive **recommender system** using **Amazon Electronics product reviews**, and accurately forecast user ratings (1 to 5 stars) for a hidden test dataset.

The dataset was provided by the instructor and hosted on Kaggle, where students competed to achieve the best RMSE score on unseen data.

> **Goal:** Predict missing product ratings using real-world Amazon data and compete on a public leaderboard.

## Tools & Techniques
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- User-based Collaborative Filtering
- Hybrid Recommender System (Model blending)
- Evaluation Metric: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** via Kaggle

---

## Results & Highlights
- **Ranked 1st place** on the public Kaggle leaderboard (class-wide competition)
- Developed and evaluated multiple algorithms to optimize prediction accuracy
- Created a hybrid recommender that outperformed baseline and matrix-only models
- Submitted complete code, report, and predictions in accordance with academic and technical standards
